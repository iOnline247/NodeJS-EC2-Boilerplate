# NodeJS Boilerplate

This repo will be a copy pasta awesomesauce for any new lambda project. The settings are a good start to not only lint code, but provide a nice workflow with git.

# Installation

Once the repo is `git clone` locally, run `npm install`. This will create a transpiled version of the `./src` folder into `./dist`. Open up the `./src/index.js` file and set a breakpoint. Then open the `./dist/index.js` file and press `F5` to start debugging. The breakpoint set in the source should now hit, even though the transpiled code is running.
